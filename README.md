# Python Algorithmic Trading Bot

## Overview ðŸ“ˆ

This project involves the development and backtesting of an automated trading bot using Python. The goal is to implement various trading strategies, test their historical performance, and build a foundational framework for algorithmic trading. This project serves as a practical application of data analysis, strategy implementation, and risk management principles in a financial context.

## Core Objective

The primary objective is to implement a simple trend-following strategy (Moving Average Crossover) and evaluate its performance against historical stock data. This includes:

* **Data Acquisition**: Fetching historical price data for a stock.
* **Strategy Implementation**: Coding the logic for buy and sell signals.
* **Backtesting**: Simulating the strategy against past data to measure potential profitability and risk.

## Technology Stack

* **Language**: Python 3
* **Core Libraries**:
    * `pandas` for data manipulation
    * `yfinance` for downloading historical market data
    * `backtrader` for strategy backtesting
    * `matplotlib` for plotting and visualization

## Current Status

The project is in the initial phase. So far, a script has been created to download historical OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data for a given stock ticker and save it as a CSV file.

## How to Get Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <repo>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install yfinance pandas backtrader matplotlib
    ```

3.  **Fetch the data:**
    ```bash
    python scripts/fetch_data.py
    ```
